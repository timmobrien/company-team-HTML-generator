## Description <a name="description"></a>

This tool allows users to input information related to their employees into the command line. When the user has entered the desired amount of employees, a styled HTML website is generated. Each employee is represented by a card which contains their related information. Employees in various roles will have different required information, for example an Engineer is able to link their github which is represented by a live link in their card.
